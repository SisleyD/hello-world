# hello-world

Hi there!

My name is Bingrong (Sisley) and I'm super excited to join Github!
I've built some robots and coded some microcontroller boards. I've also dabbled in ML and DL -- quite daunting -- and I want to learn more about these areas.
I mostly code in Java and Python, although not quite enough.
I hope I can develop a positive mindset to solve more problems in life with programming!
And finally: Commit++;
